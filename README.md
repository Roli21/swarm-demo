# This is a a demo

Nothing special to see here. Have to work on a college exercise and wanted to test Hibernate Search with Lucene,
Wildfly Swarm with different fractions including JPA, CDI, EJB, JTA and JSF as well as Butterfaces.

If you find something interesting - be my guest and take whatever you need.
